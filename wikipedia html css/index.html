        Battlefield 6 is a 2025 first-person shooter game developed by
        Battlefield Studios[a] and published by Electronic Arts. Serving as the
        eighteenth installment in the Battlefield series, the game was released
        for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025. The
        single-player campaign is set in 2027–2028 and features a conflict
        between a fractured NATO and Pax Armata, a private military company. The
        multiplayer mode features four character classes: Assault, Engineer,
        Support, and Recon, who each specialize with different weapons and
        combat strategies, and has several returning game modes with the new
        Escalation mode being added. After Battlefield 2042 (2021) received
        critical derision from both critics and players, a new title in the
        series began development under the leadership of Vince Zampella.
        Influenced by previous entries Battlefield 3 (2011) and Battlefield 4
        (2013), Battlefield 6 takes a serious tone. With an estimated budget
        exceeding $400 million, the game is one of the most expensive video
        games to develop. Following leaks from March 2025 to July, Battlefield 6
        was officially revealed the latter month. The open beta periods were
        held in August, with the first attracting over 500,000 concurrent
        players on Steam. Battlefield 6 received positive reviews from critics
        upon its release, however its campaign received criticism.

        Similar to its predecessors, Battlefield 6 is a first-person shooter.
        The game features four character classes: Assault, Engineer, Support,
        and Recon. The Assault class is proficient with assault rifles and
        grenade launchers and favors a run-and-gun playstyle with faster health
        regeneration. The Engineer class uses submachine guns, can repair
        friendly vehicles, and specializes in destroying hostile vehicles with
        rockets. The Support class excels with light machine guns and supports
        teammates by resupplying ammo, placing makeshift cover, and healing and
        reviving allies. The Recon class can carry out battlefield
        reconnaissance, uses sniper rifles, and is ideal for long-range
        engagements as a headshot kill prevents opponents from being revived.[2]
        While any class can use any weapon, each class has unique gameplay perks
        when using specific weapons. For example, Recon players can hold their
        breath while aiming with a sniper rifle.[3] Weapons can be extensively
        customized with mods, but each weapon has a designated attachment point
        limit that cannot be exceeded.[4] Battlefield 6 also introduces several
        quality-of-life improvements, including a new movement system called the
        "Kinesthetic Combat System", which allows players to lean around cover,
        hitchhike onto vehicles, and drag fallen soldiers to safety before
        reviving them.[3] As with previous entries in the series, the game
        emphasizes environmental destructibility. Buildings can be demolished
        with explosives, and obstacles or floors can be destroyed to create new
        paths. Maps are sprawling, suitable for both infantry and vehicular
        combat. Each map also includes "Combat Zones"—smaller, more confined
        areas designed for close-quarters combat.[5] At launch nine maps are
        available, with additional maps planned for release through post-launch
        updates.[6] Battlefield 6 offers multiple multiplayer modes, including
        returning modes such as Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush, Team Deathmatch,
        Squad Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. The battle royale
        mode from Battlefield V is expected to return. A new mode, Escalation,
        pits two teams against each other as they seek to control capture points
        in a map. However, the number of points gradually decreases, funneling
        players into specific map areas.
