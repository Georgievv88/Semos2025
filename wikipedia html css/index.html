    <h1>The Moon</h1>
    <p>
      The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest satellite
      in the Solar System. It is about one-quarter the size of Earth and the
      largest natural satellite relative to the size of its planet.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Moon orbits Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km. It takes
      roughly 27.3 days to complete one orbit around Earth. Because of tidal
      locking, we always see the same side of the Moon from Earth.

    <h2>Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      The Moon has been a focus of human curiosity for centuries. The first
      successful human landing occurred in 1969 during NASAâ€™s Apollo 11 mission.
      Since then, several robotic missions have explored its surface and studied
      its composition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern programs continue to plan future lunar exploration, including
      potential bases for long-term human presence.
